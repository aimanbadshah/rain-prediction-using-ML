Rain Prediction with Machine Learning
Welcome to the Rain Prediction with Machine Learning repository! This project aims to evaluate various machine learning models for predicting rain based on weather attributes.

Overview
In this project, we leverage machine learning algorithms to predict whether it will rain tomorrow using historical weather data. The dataset used for training and evaluation is available at the following URL:
